# Kill-Mouse-Acceleration
Small utility app for turning off mouse acceleration (ie. making it linear) and switching it back on.
The project was one of my first apps to learn Objective-C and this version has been re-written in Swift.

If you want a runnable .app binary I can make a release for you: Just [create an issue](https://github.com/scarlac/Kill-Mouse-Acceleration/issues/new) and I'll make a downloadable for you :)
